## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-26

First public release.

### Added
- `introspect` skill: scans a target repo's stack and generates a tailored harness
  (root `CLAUDE.md` spine — including an explicit `## Agents` routing block so the
  main agent delegates to the right agent without being named — + stack `*-architect`
  agent + `.claude/harness-kit.json` verify config + specs/ADR scaffolding).
- `detect.sh` detection engine with a 23-case test suite — layered-precedence
  detection of language / framework / test-runner / package-manager / monorepo /
  data-layer, plus **typecheck/lint command** detection and **polyglot per-subtree**
  detection (a python root with a node subtree is no longer mislabelled). Reads
  configs statically.
- `verify-loop` Stop hook — the feedback half of plan→work→verify→feedback, wired
  to the repo's real verify command via the generated `.claude/harness-kit.json`.
  Non-blocking by default (reminds, does not auto-run); opt into enforcement with
  `"blocking": true`. 4-case isolation test suite.
- `change-verifier` read-only critic agent.
- `protected-branch-guard` PreToolUse hook (asks before commit/push on a protected
  branch). Branches are configurable per repo via `.claude/harness-kit.json`
  `protected_branches` — precedence: env override > repo config > built-in default.
  Now reads the branch from `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` (not the hook's cwd).
- `.claude/harness-kit.json` is the single per-repo config for both hooks
  (`verify_command`, `blocking`, `protected_branches`).
- `update-block.sh` — idempotent marked-block updater so an introspect re-run
  replaces its own `CLAUDE.md` block instead of stacking copies.
- Test suites: detection (23) + verify-loop (4) + guard (6) + update-block (4); CI
  runs every `tests/*_test.sh`.
- Plugin + marketplace manifests, MIT license, community-profile files, CI.
